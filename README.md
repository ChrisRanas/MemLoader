## Usage

### Running Executables

To run an executable in memory, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Executable**: Ensure your PE or .NET executable is ready for in-memory execution.
2. **Load the Executable**: Use the MemLoader API to load your executable.
3. **Execute**: Trigger the execution of your loaded application.

### Example Code

Here is a simple example of how to use MemLoader to run an executable:

```csharp
using MemLoader;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string pathToExecutable = "path_to_your_executable.exe";
        Loader loader = new Loader();
        loader.LoadAndExecute(pathToExecutable);
    }
}
```

### Command-Line Options

MemLoader also supports command-line execution. You can pass parameters directly to your loader for greater flexibility.

```bash
MemLoader.exe -file path_to_your_executable.exe -param1 value1 -param2 value2
```
